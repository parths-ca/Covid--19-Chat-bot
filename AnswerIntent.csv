death,"There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19. See How to Protect Yourself & Others to learn how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like COVID-19, if you decide to attend a funeral or visitation.
COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. This type of spread is not a concern after death. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community's cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, face shield, or goggles and N-95 respirator).
If desired, you may retrieve the belongings of a loved one who has died of COVID-19 outside their home (for example, in a hospital setting). Depending on local rules and regulations, family members may retrieve these belongings at the funeral home or the healthcare facility. You should use gloves and practice good hand hygiene when handling your loved ones' belongings. Depending on the type of belongings, such as electronics, you should also follow the household item-specific cleaning and disinfection guidelines when handling these items."
greeting,"Hi, How can I help you?"
info,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people and others cause illness in animals. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold. COVID-19 is a new disease that has not been previously identified in humans. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people, and more rarely, these can then spread from person to person through close contact. There have been 2 other specific coronaviruses that have spread from animals to humans and which have caused severe illness in humans. These are the: 
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV)
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS CoV)

Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more commonly reported symptoms include: 
new or worsening cough
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
temperature equal to or over 38Â°C 
feeling feverish
chills
fatigue or weakness
muscle or body aches
new loss of smell or taste
headache
gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting)
feeling very unwell

Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal symptoms, and skin changes or rashes. In severe cases, infection can lead to death. Symptoms  may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.  Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes people who: 
have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)
never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)
While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening among those in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.
People with COVID-19 have reported a wide range of symptoms, from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. If you have fever, cough, or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19."
pets,"At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19. Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak. However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it's always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene."
precaution,"Medical masks, including surgical, medical procedure face masks and respirators (like N95 masks), must be kept for health care workers and others providing direct care to COVID-19 patients. Wearing a non-medical mask or face covering while out in public is recommended for periods of time when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre physical distance from others, particularly in crowded public settings, such as: 
stores
shopping areas
public transportation
Public health officials will make recommendations based on a number of factors, including the rates of infection and/or transmission in the community. Recommendations may vary from location to location. If you do choose to wear one, refer to the: 
guidelines on wearing non-medical masks and how to make your own
COVID-19 Special Advisory Committee's recommendations on the use of non-medical cloth masks or face coverings in community settings
Masks alone will not prevent the spread of COVID-19. You must consistently and strictly adhere to good hygiene and public health measures, including frequent hand washing and physical (social) distancing.
Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including: 
avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings
avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes
limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health
keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others
Large group events  (mass gatherings) are settings or  events where large numbers of people may be in close contact. It's unlikely that  governments will allow mass gatherings to take place anytime soon.  Event organizers  and planners should speak with their public health authorities for  recommendations. You may need to cancel, postpone or change in-person  gatherings. You may be able to re-design your event to meet physical distancing  guidelines, such as offering virtual or online alternatives.
Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work."
risk,"COVID-19 is a serious health threat, and the situation is evolving daily. The risk will vary between and within communities, but given the increasing number of cases in Canada, the risk to Canadians is considered high. This does not mean that all Canadians will get the disease. It means that there is already a significant impact on our health care system. If we do not flatten the epidemic curve now, the increase of COVID-19 cases could impact health care resources available to Canadians. The risk for COVID-19 may be increased for certain settings such as: 
cruise ships
crowded areas (such as public transit and shopping centres)
gatherings (spiritual and cultural settings, theatres, sports arenas, festivals and conferences)
Surfaces frequently touched with hands are most likely to be contaminated, including: 
tables
handrails
doorknobs
electronics
countertops
light switches
faucet handles
cabinet handles
elevator buttons
Products shipped within or from outside of Canada could also be contaminated. However, because parcels generally take days or weeks to be delivered, and are shipped at room temperature, the risk of spread is low. There is no known risk of coronaviruses entering Canada on parcels or packages. To protect yourself from COVID-19, make sure to do the following when handling products shipped within or outside of Canada: 
use good hygiene measures
regularly clean and disinfect surfaces
do not touch your eyes, nose and mouth
There is currently no evidence to suggest that food is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus and there are currently no reported cases of COVID 19 transmission through food. People are unlikely to be infected with the virus through food. Scientists and food safety authorities across the world are closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19. If we become aware of a potential food safety risk, appropriate actions will be taken to ensure the safety of Canada's food supply. Coronaviruses are killed by common cleaning and disinfection methods and by cooking food to safe internal temperatures. Learn more about food safety.
COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19."
spread,"Human coronaviruses cause infections of the nose, throat and lungs. They are most commonly spread from an infected person through: 
respiratory droplets generated when you cough or sneeze
close, prolonged personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands
touching something with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands
Current evidence suggests person-to-person spread is efficient when there is close contact.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing."
tracing,"Contact tracing has been used for decades by state and local health departments to slow or stop the spread of infectious diseases. Contact tracing slows the spread of COVID-19 by Letting people know they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and should monitor their health for signs and symptoms of COVID-19 Helping people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 get tested Asking people to self-isolate if they have COVID-19 or self-quarantine if they are a close contact of someone with COVID-19 During contact tracing, the health department staff will not ask you for Money Social Security number Bank account information Salary information Credit card numbers.
Discussions with health department staff are confidential. This means that your personal and medical information will be kept private and only shared with those who may need to know, like your health care provider. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, your name will not be shared with those you came in contact with. The health department will only notify people you were in close contact with (within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes) that they might have been exposed to COVID-19. Each state and jurisdiction use their own method for collecting and protecting health information. To learn more, contact your state or local health department. You may also be interested in: If I participate contact tracing for COVID-19 using a digital tool, is my personal health information secure?
For COVID-19, a close contact is anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes. An infected person can spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) before the person had any symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19.
You are still considered a close contact even if you were wearing a mask while you were around someone with COVID-19. Masks are meant to protect other people in case you are infected, and not to protect you from becoming infected."
trip,"While the Government of Canada advises that you avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada, there may be times when travel is essential. If you must travel despite the advisory or are already outside Canada, get the latest advice and information for your safety and security. If you do travel outside Canada, you should expect increased health screening measures at points of entry for international destinations, including airports and land borders. Local authorities may impose control measures suddenly, including movement restrictions such as quarantines. When traveling for essential reasons, take precautions against respiratory  illnesses,  and seek medical attention if you become sick. During your trip, avoid large crowds or crowded areas, avoid contact with sick people, especially if they have a cough, fever or difficulty breathing, be aware of the local situation and follow local public health advice, wash your hands often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds, use alcohol-based hand sanitizer  if soap and water are not available and always keep some with you when  you travel practise  proper cough  and sneeze etiquette
If you are Canadian or a permanent resident, and you have symptoms  consistent with COVID-19, you may still  enter Canada by land, rail or sea when returning. You may not enter Canada by air, to protect the health of all  travellers. If you need it, we will provide you with immediate medical attention when you arrive in Canada. If you have symptoms, you must isolate for 14 days. This is mandatory. 
You  must isolate in a place where you will not have contact with vulnerable people,  such as: 
people 65 years or older, or 
people with underlying medical  conditions
You  will need to confirm you have a suitable place to isolate where you will have  access to  basic necessities, such as food and medication
You must  use private transportation (such as your own vehicle) to get to your place of  isolation
You  must wear a non-medical mask or face covering while traveling to your place of  isolation
If you do not have  private transportation or an adequate place to isolate, the Chief Public Health  Officer of Canada will designate a facility where you must isolate for 14 days."
